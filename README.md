# FinalProject17

The project is going to be a game in which the player has to go through 5 levels in a dungeon.  As the player progresses through the dungeon,
the levels become increasing difficult, with tougher monsters to fight.
However, the player will be able to pick up new weapons to help him/her in battle.
These accessories can be obtained after fighting the monsters.
Use these newly found weapons to kill the final boss to obtain Dayo's treasure and beat the game!

Notes:  Had to scrap the random pick a door aspect and health potions from the game.
